# Shopify-Backend-Intern-Challenge-2022

## Functionality
- Create, edit, delete, and view inventory items
- Export to CSV

## Prerequisites: 
- Python 3.9.x
- Windows 10
    - Note: This was built and tested in Windows 10, and so I do not have the ability to verify it works on other operating systems. I will provide Linux/Unix equivalent instructions, but cannot guarantee they work.
    
## Instructions
1. Download this project.
2. Open terminal application of choice (CMD or PowerShell), and navigate to the root directory of the project: `[where did you put it]/Shopify-Backend-Intern-Challenge-2022/`
3. Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to download necessary packages. 
    - Linux: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Navigate to `/Shopify-Backend-Intern-Challenge-2022/inventory-project/`
5. Start the local server by running `python -m manage runserver`
    - Linux: `python manage.py runserver`
6. The web application will then be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/inventoryapp/`.
